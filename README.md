# TwitchTokBot: Automating Content Creation
### Summary:

    Using various Python libraries and access to the Twitch and TikTok APIs, this script automates 
    "clipping" and uploading videos directly to Tik Tok account. This enables small creators who cannot
    afford an editor/social media manager to build a presence on other platforms with their content.
    Clips are automatically generated based on spike in chat activity.
